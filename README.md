# Coding-Challenge-6
This is a repository for Coding-Challenge-6 for the ISM3232 Class where we will create a Employee Shift Management System.
In this challenge, we will use objects, template literals, object and array methods, control structures, and functions to achieve its goals. We will use these concepts to manage the employee shift schedules for a small business. This system wil track employees and their assigned shifts, check employee availability based on their exsting shifts, assign new shfits to available employees, and calculate total hours worked by each employee for the week.
